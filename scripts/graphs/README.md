# Graph scripts

This folder contains Python scripts to generate the plots in the ICN'18 paper.
As a general rule, the plots in section 6 of the paper were generated by calling `plot.py`, using the following base command:

`python plot.py --data-dir <input-dir> --output-dir <output-dir> --case <case> --subcase <subcase> --test-file <.test file>`

* `--data-dir <input-dir>` : dir w/ input data, as generated by an `rid-analytics` test
* `--output-dir <output-dir>` : dir on which to save resulting plots, in .pdf format, embedded fonts
* `--case <case> --subcase <subcase>` : scenario to be plotted (see section 6)
* `--test-file <.test file>` : info about the `rid-analytics` test which generated the data **(THIS ARG IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED, BUT NOT USED)**

We didn't include the data to generate them in this Github repo (available for download as a .zip file here).
However, we leave the correspondence between figures and data folders below.
